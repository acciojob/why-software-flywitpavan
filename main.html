    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I am motivated to become a software developer because I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. The ability to create applications that can make a positive impact on people's lives excites me. I enjoy the challenge of translating ideas into functional software, and I find satisfaction in continuous learning and adapting to new technologies. Being part of a community that values innovation and creativity is also a significant motivation for me.
